One important component of these tools is the <a href='http://ipython.org/notebook'>IPython Notebook</a>, platform in which narrative text, data visualizations, mathematical annotations, code in a variety of languages, and more can be combined into one seamless and sharable document. The notebook is fundamentally a browser-based application, in which client-side javascript interacts with the Python kernel to execute snippets of code and display the results. This design choice has opened the way for a host of extensions which take advantage of the browser front-end to enable powerful interactive visualizations.</p><p>In this talk Jake will demonstrate some of the recent developments in notebook-based interactive visualization: these include the kernel-aware javascript widgets of the recent IPython 2.0 release; the <a href='http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/JSAnimation/blob/master/animation_example.ipynb'>JSAnimation</a> library, which builds clean javascript-powered animations from native matplotlib code; and the new <a href='http://mpld3.github.io/'>mpld3</a> package, which translates matplotlib plots into interactive D3js-based visualizations.</p>",
